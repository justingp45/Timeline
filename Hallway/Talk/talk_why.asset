  - dialogueText: "Looks like they\u2019re starting to raise the difficulty with
      this puzzle."

    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: But unlike the previous puzzles we solved, we have access to the
      two old rooms we were in before.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "My best guess is that we\u2019re supposed to use ALL THREE rooms
      as one bigger puzzle."

  - dialogueText: Like, the bed symbol lines up perfectly with the symbol for the

  - dialogueText: "That can\u2019t be a coincidence. Not to mention we didn\u2019t
      solve everything in those rooms."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: We must need to backtrack to these rooms in order to get everything
      we need.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: "So, if we can\u2019t figure out a puzzle in this room, we might
      need to use the OTHER rooms to solve it."
