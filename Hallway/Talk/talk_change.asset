  - dialogueText: I don't know. Probably because we started up a new puzzle.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: I definitely remember this shutter being open before. So why suddenly
      close it?
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "Maybe\u2026 we solved the first room faster than we were supposed
      to?"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: That might actually explain why that Indigo guy had to knock me
      out.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 13
  - dialogueText: 'Which begs the question: were we supposed to do this puzzle first
      and then go into the bathroom?'
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: Yeah, actually, this is starting to piece things together!
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: We were supposed to take longer than Indigo anticipated, so he
      was still setting things up around the house.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: Then, when we solved it, Indigo panicked, and rushed out to try
      and stop us from getting too far.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: "He knocked me out, then didn\u2019t know how to fix us doing things
      out of order."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: So, he decided to swap the order of the puzzles to try and buy
      time to fix things.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "And that\u2019s why I woke up in the shower rather than going
      through the puzzles normally."
