  dialogueData:
  - dialogueText: Yeah a few, actually.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "First off, I can\u2019t explain the discrepancy between the two
      pages."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: It looks like this Chromatic Project is old. Like, REALLY old.
      Over 40 years.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: But that would mean that this Indigo guy is at least 60 or more
      years old if he was involved in it.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "It\u2019s hard to imagine a 60-year-old guy being able to knock
      me out so easily, though."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 13
  - dialogueText: Maybe this Indigo guy is younger and just found the project from
      before and tried to replicate it?
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: But back to the contradiction, why would a 40-year-old project
      suddenly be happening right now?
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: And before you mention the Extended Testing thing, I remember clearly
      that they said Chromatic Project.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "That can\u2019t be a coincidence. There\u2019s got to be a connection
      between this and the other project."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: Not to mention this project was supposed to be terminated back
      then.
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "Unless\u2026 Pandora isn\u2019t actually holding this program.
      THAT\u2019S IT!"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: Someone ACTING as Pandora must be doing this project instead!
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 8
  - dialogueText: "So then\u2026 the people I interviewed with weren\u2019t actually
      part of Pandora?"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "But if that\u2019s the case, I GOT SCAMMED!"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 6
  - dialogueText: These guys are actually trying to hold me hostage, not test me!
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 5
  - dialogueText: "But\u2026 no that\u2019s not right either."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: Why kidnap me with a phony project and then set up the project
      anyways?
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "GAH! Every time I think I\u2019ve figured it out another problem
      blocks the way."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 9
  - dialogueText: "I\u2019m also curious what happened to Amy too. Why wasn\u2019t
      she with us?"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "Maybe she got locked up somewhere else and she\u2019s doing the
      same thing as us?"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "That\u2019s my best guess. She must be somewhere else in the house."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 0
  - dialogueText: "We\u2019ve got to find her! The more people helping us out, the
      better."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 1
  - dialogueText: "Though\u2026 what happened to the other 14 subjects? And why are
      only 5 listed in isolation?"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: I think something happened with the test. But what?
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 7
  - dialogueText: "Didn\u2019t it just start? God I have so many questions!"
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 9
  - dialogueText: "I think I\u2019m just going to keep going in circles unless I
      find new information."
    characterSpeaking: 1
    expression: 3
  - dialogueText: Well, one more reason to solve this puzzle and get out of here.
