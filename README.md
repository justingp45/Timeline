# Timeline

Timeline is a project started in Fall of 2021 by a group of students in CSU Fullerton's Video Game Development Club. This is our collective efforts over the past semester. 

Timeline is a puzzle game where the player is tasked with helping a man named Leo escape from his childhood home. At first glance, this task seems simple enough, but dig under the surface and you'll find there's a lot more going on than meets the eye.

will allow you to play through the first level of the game and explore some of the basic story developed for the game.
